\section{Background and Motivation}
Llms and Agents leveraging LLMs have revolutionized the field of software engineering, enabling new paradigms in automated programming and repair. However, the integration of these models into existing software development workflows remains a challenge. This thesis aims to explore the potential of LLMs in enhancing automated program repair (APR) systems, particularly in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments.
\section{Problem Statement}
modern APR systems requiremt a lot of computational power budget and manual effort \cite{puvvadiCodingAgentsComprehensive2025}

\section{Objectives and Research Questions}
The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of LLMs in APR within the Software Development Lifecycle (CI/CD pipelines) in budget restrained environment. The research questions guiding this investigation include:
