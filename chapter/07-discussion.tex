\section{Validility}
- quixbugs a small dataset, not representative of real world software development
- only python, not representative of real world software development
- but shows the potential of applying llm based agents in a real world cicd environment

\section{Potentials}
- can take over small tasks in encapuslated envrioment without intervention

- small models can solve more problems with retrying with feedback

\section{Limitations}
- potential is highly dependand on model
- github actions from github have a lot of computational noise
- workflow runs on every issue and therefor has some ci minute overhead this could be solved by using a github app which replies on webhook events

-- SECURITY ISSUE: Prompt injection in issue: CICD makes this a bit safer?

\section{Summary of Findings}
\section{Lessons Learned}
- ai is a fast moving field with a lot of noise


\section{Roadmap for Extensions}
- Service Accoutns for better and mroe transparent integration
- try out complex agent architectures and compare metrics and results
- try out more complex bug fixing tasks - SWE bench
