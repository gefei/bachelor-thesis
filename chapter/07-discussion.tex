\section{Validity}
- Quixbugs a small dataset, not representative of real world software development
- only python, not representative of real world software development
- but shows the potential of applying llm based agents in a real world CD/CD environment

\section{Potentials}
- can take over small tasks in encapsulated environment without intervention
- small models can solve more problems with retrying with feedback
- this concept is applicable to other python repositories
- configuration makes it adjustable to different repositories and environments

complex agent architectures produce good results epically paired with containerized environments. \cite{puvvadiCodingAgentsComprehensive2025}

\ref{houLargeLanguageModels2024}
- accelerate bug fixing
- lets developers focus on more complex tasks
- therefor enhance software reliability and maintainability

\section{Limitations}
- github actions from github have a lot of computational noise
- workflow runs on every issue and therefor has some ci minute overhead this could be solved by using a github app which replies on webhook events

-- SECURITY ISSUE: Prompt injection in issue: CI/CD makes this a bit safer?

- its limit to small issues

\section{Summary of Findings}
\section{Lessons Learned}
- ai is a fast moving field with a lot of noise


\section{Roadmap for Extensions}
- Service Accounts for better and more transparent integration
- try out complex agent architectures and compare metrics and results
- try out more complex bug fixing tasks - SWE bench
