Agent Based

llms lay the groundwork of a new APR paradigm \cite{chenUnveilingPitfallsUnderstanding2025}

complex agent arcitectures produce good results espically paired with containerized environments. Emphasis on quality insureance and Devops practices \cite{puvvadiCodingAgentsComprehensive2025}
