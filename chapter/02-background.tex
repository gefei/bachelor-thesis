Continous Integration and Continous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software development practice that emphasizes frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing and deployment. This approach aims to enhance collaboration, reduce integration issues, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.

Bug fixing is a highly resource intensive task in software engineering, consiting of multiple stages .
